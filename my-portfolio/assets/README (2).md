Pre-trained Keras checkpoints are also in the repo under [`weights/`](weights/). Copy the file you need into `models/` for local inference, or change `DEFAULT_MODEL_PATH` in `src/drowsiness/config.py`.

## Problem statement

Driver **drowsiness** is a major safety risk. This project focuses on a **proxy task**: from a **crop of the eye region**, classify whether the subject appears **awake** or **sleepy** (eyes open vs. closed / drowsy pattern). That supports downstream applications such as in-cabin alerts, provided real-world validation is done separately.

## Exploratory analysis (from `notebooks/01_data_gathering.ipynb`)

What the EDA code actually does:

1. **Inventory** — Recursively collects all `*.png` under `data/MRL/data` and reports **total image count** (~85k in the logged run).
2. **Stratification check** — For each split (`train` / `val` / `test`) and class (`awake` / `sleepy`), counts images and computes **class ratios** (~0.506 awake / ~0.494 sleepy per split in the saved outputs).
3. **Resolution exploration** — Samples images with PIL, records **width × height**, aggregates **unique size frequencies**, and plots a **histogram of image widths** to see how consistent resolutions are before resizing.
4. **Qualitative review** — Displays **sample images** per split/class (awake vs sleepy) for a quick visual sanity check.
5. **TensorFlow pipeline prototype** — Builds `tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory` on train/val/test with **grayscale**, fixed **64×64** resize, **binary** labels, batching, and shows a **single batch shape** after preprocessing.
6. **Augmentation + `tf.data`** — Defines **horizontal `RandomFlip`** and small **`RandomRotation`** (0.05), applies them only when training; normalizes to **[0, 1]**; uses **`shuffle(1000)`**, **`cache()`**, and **`prefetch(AUTOTUNE)`** for efficient input pipelines (mirrors the training notebook).

## Modeling approach (`notebooks/02_baseline_cnn.ipynb`)

- **Input:** 64×64×1 grayscale, **binary** labels, **batch size 64**.
- **Augmentation (training):** `RandomFlip("horizontal")`, `RandomRotation(0.05)`; val/test without augmentation.
- **Baseline CNN (`baseline_cnn_mrl`):** Three **Conv2D** blocks (32 → 64 → 128 filters, 3×3, ReLU, `padding="same"`) each followed by **MaxPooling2D(2×2)** → **Flatten** → **Dense(128, relu)** → **Dense(1, sigmoid)**.
- **Training:** **Adam** (lr 1e-3), **binary cross-entropy**, metrics include **accuracy**; additional experiments in the same notebook train **augmented** and **deeper** variants and save `cnn_mrl_driver_aug.keras` and `cnn_mrl_driver_aug_deep.keras`.

## Evaluation metrics & results

On the **held-out test** set (**16,981** images, **2** classes), the baseline run reaches about **98.6% test accuracy** with **precision / recall / F1 ≈ 0.99** (macro/weighted). The notebook also reports **confusion matrices**, **ROC curves with AUC**, **misclassification examples**, and **threshold** sweeps for sleepy vs awake. See the **GitHub Pages** link at the top for a compact comparison of all three saved models and direct **downloads**.

## How to run

1. **EDA:** `notebooks/01_data_gathering.ipynb`
2. **Train / evaluate:** `notebooks/02_baseline_cnn.ipynb`
3. **Video:** place weights in `models/`, add `data/test_input/test_video.mp4`, then `python scripts/detect_video.py`
4. **Webcam:** `python scripts/detect_live.py`

---

## Conclusion & recommendations

The CNNs reach **strong metrics on the curated MRL test split**. Real deployment still needs checks on **lighting, pose, glasses, and domain shift**; consider **calibrating thresholds** on your own video and exploring **temporal** models for smoother alerts.
